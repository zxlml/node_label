# Implemented codes for "Towards Precise and Explainable Hardware Trojan Localization at LUT Level" accepted by TCAD.

# Language: Python

# Code descriptions:

1) The main function that the open source code runs is main() in main.py.

2) Input of main function:

The synthesized FPGA netlist as graph_intel.v in the example.

3) Output of main function:

The name of the LUT cell and the probability that its output is 1.

The result is automatically stored in ./example/prob1.txt.
